## Functionality

A **modern Python project** that retrieves Azure Retail Prices from the official REST API, supports **API response pagination**, and converts results to JSON and CSV formats with **automated daily exports**.

The project includes both **manual export scripts** for custom use cases and **automated GitHub Actions workflows** that provide daily updated price data to the community.

**Key Features:**

- 🚀 **Automated Daily Exports** - Fresh price data available as GitHub releases
- 💱 **FX Rate Calculation** - Exchange rates calculated from multi-currency price comparisons
- ✅ **Modern Python 3.10+** - Type hints, structured logging, comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Robust API integration** - Handles pagination, timeouts, and graceful error recovery
- ✅ **Smart caching** - Resumes interrupted exports, 1-day API response caching
- ✅ **Multiple formats** - JSON and CSV output with configurable options
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bars during long exports
- ✅ **Production ready** - Comprehensive testing, linting, and CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ **Developer friendly** - Full VS Code integration, Poetry dependency management

## Prerequisites

The script requires the following dependencies:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data manipulation and CSV export
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/) - HTTP library for API calls
- [requests-cache](https://pypi.org/project/requests-cache/) - Caching requests to the API
- [enlighten](https://pypi.org/project/enlighten/) - Progress bars and status display
- [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) - Efficient data processing
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Numerical computing support

**Python Version:** 3.10+ required

We recommend using **Poetry** for dependency management and virtual environments.

### Installation with Poetry (Recommended)

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you haven't already:

   ```console
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Install dependencies and create virtual environment:

   ```console
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```console
   poetry shell
   ```

### Alternative: Python without Poetry

If you prefer not to use Poetry, you can install dependencies directly:

```console
pip install pandas requests-cache enlighten pyarrow requests numpy
```

For development dependencies:

```console
pip install pytest black ruff
```

## Usage

Here are examples of how to use the export scripts:

### Export all Azure Products in USD

```console
poetry run python export_prices_all_usd.py
```

This creates the file `prices_USD.csv` with all Azure product prices.

### Export prices for Virtual Machines with filters

```console
poetry run python export_prices_vm_usd.py
```

```console
poetry run python export_prices_with_filter_and_multiple_currencies.py
```

### Available Export Scripts

- `export_prices_all_usd.py` - All products in USD (CSV format)
- `export_prices_all_usd_json.py` - All products in USD (JSON format)
- `export_prices_all_eur.py` - All products in EUR
- `export_prices_vm_usd.py` - Virtual Machines only in USD
- `export_prices_with_filter_and_multiple_currencies.py` - Custom filters with multiple currencies
- `export_prices_all_usd_limit_10_pages.py` - Limited export for testing
- `export_fxrates.py` - **NEW**: Calculate and export FX rates based on USD

### Export FX Rates

The `export_fxrates.py` script calculates foreign exchange rates by comparing Azure retail prices across different currencies:

```console
poetry run python export_fxrates.py
```

This creates the file `fxrates_usd.csv` with calculated exchange rates for multiple currencies.

**How it works:**
- Uses a specific meterId (`5daea80f-04ac-5385-86f0-b263d23becd2`) to ensure consistent price comparison across currencies
- Fetches Azure prices in USD (base currency) and multiple target currencies for this specific meter
- Calculates FX rates by comparing the same product's price in different currencies
- Exports results with currency and exchange rate

**Example output:**
```
currency,fxRate
EUR,0.8523
GBP,0.7421
JPY,110.2341
```

This is useful for:
- Multi-currency cost analysis
- Currency conversion validation
- Historical FX rate tracking
- Budget planning in different regions

## Configuration

The application supports environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# API Configuration
export AZURE_PRICE_API_VERSION="2023-01-01-preview"  # API version to use
export REQUEST_TIMEOUT="30"                           # Request timeout in seconds
export CACHE_EXPIRE_DAYS="1"                         # Cache expiration in days

# Retry Configuration (for handling rate limiting)
export MAX_RETRIES="5"                               # Maximum number of retries for failed requests
export RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR="2.0"                    # Exponential backoff multiplier (wait: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
```

**Default values** are used if environment variables are not set.

## Code Layout

The project structure is organized as follows:

```text
azureretailprices-exporter/
├── api/
│   ├── azureapi.py          # Main API client (modernized)
│   ├── azureapi_modern.py   # Class-based API client example
│   └── tests/               # Unit tests
├── export_*.py              # Example export scripts
├── pyproject.toml           # Poetry dependencies and configuration
├── poetry.lock              # Locked dependency versions
└── .vscode/                 # VS Code configuration
    ├── settings.json        # Python interpreter settings
    ├── launch.json          # Debug configurations
    ├── tasks.json           # Poetry tasks
    └── extensions.json      # Recommended extensions
```

**Core functionality** is in `api/azureapi.py`. The `export_*.py` scripts are examples showing different usage patterns.

## Caching

The script uses [requests-cache](https://pypi.org/project/requests-cache) to temporarily cache API results. This is useful if the script stops unexpectedly and you need to resume later.

**Cache settings:**

- **Duration:** 1 day by default (configurable via `CACHE_EXPIRE_DAYS`)
- **Storage:** SQLite file `azure_cache.sqlite`
- **Clearing:** Delete the cache file to clear cached data

## Error Handling

The modernized codebase includes comprehensive error handling:

- ✅ **HTTP errors** - Graceful handling of API failures with proper status codes
- ✅ **Rate limiting (HTTP 429)** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff using urllib3.Retry
- ✅ **Network timeouts** - Configurable request timeouts (default: 30 seconds)
- ✅ **JSON parsing errors** - Robust handling of malformed API responses
- ✅ **Logging** - Structured logging instead of print statements
- ✅ **Retry logic** - Automatic retries for 429, 500, 502, 503, 504 errors with exponential backoff

**Retry Behavior:**
- Automatically retries failed requests up to 5 times (configurable via `MAX_RETRIES`)
- Uses exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s (configurable via `RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR`)
- Respects `Retry-After` header from API responses
- Handles temporary server errors and rate limiting gracefully

**Debugging:** Set logging level to `DEBUG` for detailed troubleshooting information.
